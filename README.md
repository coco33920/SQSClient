SQSClient : Client for the Simple Quizz System : must be used with SQSApi and a SQSServer
You must change the code and rebuild ( mvn clean install for Desktop and mvn clean jpro:deploy for Web ) to accomodate with your own version of SQS on your server
I will not provide any pre compiled binaries.

Feel free to comment, contribute and post issues if you test the code !
